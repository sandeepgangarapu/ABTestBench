      An A/B test comparing two checkout flows shows:
      - Control: mean completion time = 180 seconds, std = 45 seconds
      - Treatment: mean completion time = 165 seconds, std = 40 seconds

      Calculate Cohen's d for this difference (using pooled standard deviation).

      rubric: |
        Award credit for:
        - Correct pooled SD calculation: sqrt((45² + 40²)/2) ≈ 42.6
        - Correct Cohen's d: (180-165)/42.6 ≈ 0.35
        - Interpreting as "small-to-medium" effect

      An A/B test shows:
      - Control conversion rate: 3.2%
      - Treatment conversion rate: 4.0%

      Calculate Cohen's h (the effect size for proportions) for this difference.

        Credit for:
        - Using h = 2*arcsin(sqrt(p2)) - 2*arcsin(sqrt(p1))
        - Correct calculation ≈ 0.044
        - Noting this is a very small effect

      Your A/B test shows a statistically significant result (p = 0.02):
      - Control: 2.1% conversion rate
      - Treatment: 2.3% conversion rate

      The test had n = 100,000 per group. Your business requires at least a 15%
      relative improvement to justify the engineering cost of the change.

      1. Calculate the relative lift as a percentage.
      2. Is this result practically significant for the business?

      Answer with the relative lift percentage.

      type: numeric
      value: 9.52

        - "practical significance"
        - "statistical vs practical significance"
      rubric: |
        Credit for:
        - Correctly calculating relative lift: (2.3-2.1)/2.1 ≈ 9.5%
        - Recognizing this is below the 15% business threshold
        - Distinguishing statistical from practical significance
        - Recommending against launch despite p < 0.05
