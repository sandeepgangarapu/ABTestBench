      An A/B test shows the following results:
      - Control: 1,000 users, 50 conversions (5.0%)
      - Treatment: 1,000 users, 65 conversions (6.5%)

      Calculate the p-value for a two-tailed test of the difference in proportions.

    question: |
      You're running 5 simultaneous A/B tests across different features. Each test
      uses α = 0.05.

      1. If there are no true effects, what is the probability of observing at
         least one false positive?
      2. What should the per-test α be if you want to maintain an overall
         family-wise error rate of 0.05 using Bonferroni correction?

      Provide the Bonferroni-corrected α as your final answer.

    question: |
      An A/B test for a pricing change shows:
      - Control (original $9.99): 10,000 visitors, 850 purchases, $8,492 revenue
      - Treatment ($10.99): 10,000 visitors, 780 purchases, $8,568 revenue

      The p-value for the difference in conversion rate is 0.12.
      The p-value for the difference in total revenue is 0.65.

      Should you launch the price increase? Answer "yes", "no", or "inconclusive"
      and explain your reasoning.
    expected_answer:
      type: categorical
      value: "inconclusive"
      alternatives: ["no"]

        This is a nuanced question. Award points for:
        - Recognizing neither result is statistically significant
        - Noting revenue per visitor is similar ($0.849 vs $0.857)
        - Discussing practical significance vs statistical significance
        - Recommending more data or longer test
        - Considering second-order effects (LTV, brand perception)

        Best answer acknowledges uncertainty and recommends continued testing.
