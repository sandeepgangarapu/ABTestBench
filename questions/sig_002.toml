You're running 5 simultaneous A/B tests across different features. Each test
uses α = 0.05.

1. If there are no true effects, what is the probability of observing at
   least one false positive?
2. What should the per-test α be if you want to maintain an overall
   family-wise error rate of 0.05 using Bonferroni correction?

Provide the Bonferroni-corrected α as your final answer.
