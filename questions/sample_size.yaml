    question: |
      You want to estimate the conversion rate of a landing page with a 95%
      confidence interval that has a margin of error of no more than 2 percentage
      points. Assuming you have no prior estimate of the conversion rate, what
      minimum sample size do you need?

      You're running an A/B test comparing two landing page designs. The current
      page has an 8% conversion rate. You want to detect a 25% relative increase
      (to 10%) with 80% power and 5% significance level (two-tailed). What sample
      size do you need per variant?

      You're testing a new checkout flow. Historical data shows average order value
      is $85 with a standard deviation of $45. You want to detect a $5 increase with
      90% power at α = 0.05 (two-tailed). What sample size per group is needed?
