    question: |
      An A/B test for a website button change currently has a 5% click-through rate
      (control). You want to detect a 20% relative improvement (to 6% CTR) with 80%
      power and a 5% significance level. Using a two-proportion z-test, what is the
      minimum sample size needed per group?

        Award full explanation credit if the response:
        - Correctly identifies this as a two-proportion z-test
        - Shows the formula or methodology used
        - Explains the relationship between sample size and power

    question: |
      You ran an A/B test with 5,000 users per group. The control group had a mean
      revenue of $45 with standard deviation $30. The treatment showed a mean of $47.
      What was the statistical power of this test to detect this $2 difference at
      α = 0.05?

        Award full credit if:
        - Correctly calculates Cohen's d ≈ 0.067
        - Uses appropriate power analysis method
        - Notes limitations of post-hoc power analysis

    question: |
      You're planning an A/B test with a baseline conversion rate of 12%. You have
      capacity for 50,000 users per group. What is the minimum detectable effect (MDE)
      as a relative percentage improvement, with 80% power at α = 0.05?
    expected_answer:
      type: numeric
      value: 5.8
      tolerance: 0.5
